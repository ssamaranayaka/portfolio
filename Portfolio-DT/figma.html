                    <p>Wow, that was a lot to take in right? But fortunately that was just the beginning! Next in line weâ€™ve got FIGMA. Yes, I know what all of you just thought about but to spare everyone else I wonâ€™t mention it (If you couldnâ€™t really tell I donâ€™t love that word). Well letâ€™s get back on topic, SI- I mean FIGMA. </p>
                    <p>First of all I think whoever came up with that name has to be studied. During second term we focused mainly on web designing. Well donâ€™t ask because I donâ€™t know how Figma gives off web design. </p>
                    <p>I learned how to make wireframes, make more wireframes and then mockups and even more mockups. If you didnâ€™t follow the pattern web designing mainly focuses on making wire frames and refining them to create a presentable mockup. Essentially what we did was create a visual representation of a website (Something that looks nice basically). Iâ€™ve made a movie review website layout!</p>
