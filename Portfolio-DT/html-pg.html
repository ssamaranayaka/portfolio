                    <p> Yes, Iâ€™m still here. TRUST ME youâ€™re so close to the end, because last but not least we have HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language if you want to be fancy).It looks a lot like python but it probably couldnâ€™t be more different.</p>
                    <p>First of all itâ€™s more confusing than python and for every HTML code a CSS page is necessary. So in conclusion more work but I guess if you wanted a bland boring plain website you could use only HTML:/</p>
                    <p>So essentially what Iâ€™ve learnt is that at every websitesâ€™ core lies HTML(the bones if you will). During term 3 Iâ€™ve more or less understood how to make a website that functions at a basic level and doesnâ€™t look too bad.</p>

                    <p>Experimenting with random pieces of code was really interesting and as a whole learning how to design a website was so cool. And also you can â€˜inspectâ€™ any websites code(like even chatgpt!)</p>
                    <p>And I saved the best for last,(cue suspenseful music) this whole website is made from HTML! YAY </p>
