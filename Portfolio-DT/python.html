I‚Äôm truly grateful. Well then straight to the point. Throughout this website you will be able to observe the many wonders hidden in year 11 DT. Wow, how very lucky of you to have stumbled upon my website. Great well I hope you‚Äôre ready because here we go!‚Äù)</p>

                <p class ="second-para"> Truth be told the only thing I knew about python was that it was a type of snake like how was I supposed to know a coding language was called that? Anyway throughout the first term I learnt things that I didn‚Äôt even know existed. For example f-strings, indentations, boolean operators and so much more. Don‚Äôt judge I know you don‚Äôt know what they are either! </p>
                <p class="third-para"> At the beginning of the year I was so excited to be learning coding to the point where I went home and retaught all the ‚Äòcool‚Äô things I learnt to my family but then through all that at some point I was reconsidering all my life choices, because trust me python will have you fooled and keep surprising you every chance it gets with the most random things. Like how was I supposed to know that an extra space would stop my whole code from working?</p>
                <p class="fourth-para">Honestly, learning all that python made me feel so smart because like wow I could make a working quiz in weird neon colours! Through the process of dying over assessments to learning the most random facts about python I‚Äôve learnt how to properly use while loops, create games and a lot about testing tables.</p>
